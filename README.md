into classes.

# Data Description
The dataset contains news texts including the Title, Text, Date, and Subject.
Subjects are the News classes such as: politic news, world news, politics, government news,
etc… check the dataset from this link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JPDf81mvCVAtph5_B76qdRkFTKCMZyGO/view).

# The goal from this project 
Is to build a multi-class classifier web app using flask that can classify text data (News) into different categories based on the news's title and actual content and exploring the sentiment analysis for news as well, by analyzing different approaches and linguistics resources for sentiment analysis using corpus for news and annotated each text with three categories: positive, negative and neutral. Each text was marked by at least three independent annotators via the web interface and the texts marked by all three annotators with the same category were used in the further experiments. We experimented on automate classification of these texts with CNN, SVM, LR, Naïve Bayes machine learning methods. Feature selection methods were used for the best feature set detection in each case.
